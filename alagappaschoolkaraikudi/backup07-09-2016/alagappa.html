<h3>Padmabushan Dr.Alagappa Chettiar</h3>

</p>
<h4>EARLY LIFE & EDUCATION</h4>
<img src="images/alagappa-chettiar1.jpg" width="220" height="277" />
<p>Dr. RM. Alagappa Chettiar had his primary education at the SMS Vidyasala in Karaikudi and went on to obtain his M.A. from the Presidency College in Madras. He obtained postgraduate (M.A.) Degree in English literature in 1930 from Presidency College, Madras at the age of 21. He had the fortune of befriending Dr. S. Radhakrishnan, a model teacher who later on became the President of India. At the age of 21, he became the first Indian trainee at the Chartered bank in London. Thereafter he qualified for the bar at Middle Temple in England and became a ' bar-at-law ' to be cherished by the people of Chettinad. He was conferred a doctoral degree (D.Litt) by Annamalai University in 1943 and by the Madras University (LL.D.) in 1944. The British Government knighted him in 1945. He was conferred the distinction of Padma Bhushan by the President of India on January 26, 1957. His stellar record as a business entrepreneur was acknowledged by the British government when he was knighted in 1945 at the age of 37.

 <h3> Padmabushan Dr.Alagappa Chettiar</h3>

<h4>BUSINESS ACUMEN</h4>

<img src="images/alagappa-chettiar2.jpg" width="220" height="277" />
<p>His stellar record as a business entrepreneur was acknowledged by the British Government when he was knighted in 1945 at the age of 37. He renounced the prestigious knighthood when India attained independence. The distinction of Padmabushan was conferred by the President of India on January 26, 1957. Within a span of 2 decades he demonstrated his versatility as a successful business tycoon, an intrepid academician with a vision to change the mere scrub jungle of Karaikudi to an educational Mecca. When he passed away prematurely at the age of 48, Dr. Alagappa Chettiar had redefined philanthropy and contributed more to the betterment of education in Tamil Nadu than any other person of eminence had done until then.</p>


<p>He launched his career by pioneering in textiles. As a business savvy and a model employer he practiced then, what the Harvard Business School preaches today - diversification of portfolios with rubber plantations in Malaya, Tin mines in Burma, Textile Mills in Kerala, Insurance companies in Calcutta, Hotels in Bombay, Theatres in Madras, a flourishing stock broking company and a private airline and has been referred to as the unsung business maharaja of South India in the thirties and forties. His business interests were however short lived as he changed his focus to education.
 </p>

<p>Dr. Alagappa in 1937 Started Cochin textiles at Pudhukaddu near Thiruchur in Kerala. Cochin textiles were converted as Alagappa Textiles. The Township of Cochin textile's staff was named Alagappa Nagar. Alagappa Nagar is the first and only township named of a Nagarathar in other state. He took charge the Managing responsibilities of "Jupiter general insurance company", "East and west insurance company' and "Rich Hotels". He also functioned as Air Transport Company known as "Jupiter Airways"</p>

<h3>Padmabushan Dr.Alagappa Chettiar</h3>

<h4>SERVICE TO EDUCATION</h4>
<img src="images/alagappa-chettiar3.jpg" width="220" height="277" />
<p>He harboured a firm conviction that education is an absolute must for a human being to become productive, wholesome and humane. In 1947 at the Dr. Annie Besant centenary celebrations the Vice-Chancellor of Madras University called industrialists to start colleges to educate India. Spontaneously Dr.Chettiar answered the call in the same function and within three days Alagappa Arts College started functioning at Gandhi Malighai in Karaikudi. His generous donations led to the establishment of a string of educational institution, which formed the basis for the establishment of the Alagappa University in 1985 by the Government of Tamil Nadu.</p>

<p>The Alagappa University was established in 1985 fulfilling the dream of Dr.Alagappa. Alagappa Educational intuitions is providing a continuum in education for children of the community to start from kindergarten and pursue studies right up to post doctoral studies in a wide array of subjects.</p>

<p>To bring prominence to the educational institutions he had the vision to convince Prime Minister Nehru to house one of the Government's National Research Institutes in the heart of the Alagappa campus. Dr. Radhakrishnan, the Vice President of India surmised at the opening of the Central Electro Chemical Research Institute (CECRI) on 14 Jan 1953. " The magnificent gift of 300 acres of land 1.5 million of Rupees by Dr. Alagappa Chettiar helped the Government of India to select Karaikudi as the seat of Electro Chemical Research Institute. Being a businessman himself, Dr. Alagappa Chettiar is aware of the industrial possibilities of our country and the need for scientific, technical and technological education in his lifetime he has built a monument for himself you have only to look around."</p>

<p>At the tender age of 48, in the midst of single handedly revolutionizing his native place and changing the course of history he succumbed to his illness. Perhaps his crowning piece of philanthropy was giving away his own palatial residence in Kottaiyur to found the Women's college. Rajaji has remarked, "Dr. Alagappa Chettiar had given away freely. Students should develop that quality namely giving money earned for charity. Dr.Alagappa is one who can give to good cause, cultivate courage and emulate the spirit".</p>

<p>The Trusts that have been established by the Founder viz. the Asoka Charitable Trust and the Dr.Alagappa Chettiar Educational Trust are managing the Schools and have aggressive plans for expanding, to upgrade the quality of education and provide an opportunity for the youth of the country, to fulfill their dreams</p>
