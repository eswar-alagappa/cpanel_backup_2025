        <h2>About Principal</h2>
        <div class="principalimg img-left"> <img src="images/principal.png" /></div>
        <p>It gives me an immense pleasure, in meeting you all through this media. I extend a very warm greetings, to the Parents of our school, who with great hopes have admitted their wards in our school. </p>
        <p>I strongly believe, that changes can be caused only through an education, which is the most powerful weapon. We aim not only to impart knowledge to the students, but also to inculcate in them the good habits like humanity, intelligence and kindness. </p>
        <p>Education should develop one’s individual’s critical thinking and analytical skills. According to Martin Luther King, Jr education is not just a preparation for life but it is life itself which leads to freedom. It is the duty of an every educator to develop a passion for learning, among the students which leads in action. It is also the moral responsibility of an educators, to teach the students how to fish, which helps them to lead their lives independently instead of giving a fish to eat for a day. Mere imparting knowledge to the children without teaching them moral values will make them a menace to society.</p>
        <p>It is also a prime duty of a school in imparting moral qualities and social responsibilities to the students.  We have a regular schedule of school assembly which comprises of news reading, discourses by students themselves on various topics, Kural recital, mass drill and mass Bhajans etc. </p>
        <p> These days education is associated only with an act of making money. Everyone tries to educate themselves, hoping that they would be able to make money based on the education they get. So education has become purely commercial. This trend should change and the education must aim at making ideal citizens for the country in addition to making them competent to work. On a whole, over all attitude of  an education should change for better in near future, else this world will be a chaotic place to live in.</p>
        <p>We offer a wide-ranging educational program which is supported by a system of instruction that is experiential and encourages the children to be consistent, important and methodical in thought and in application. </p>
        <p>Our aim, is to reach out all the students of the school because they are very much valuable to us.</p>
        <p>Progress is impossible without any change, and those who cannot change their minds cannot change anything.</p>
