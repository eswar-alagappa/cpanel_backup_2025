        <h2>Alagappa Matriculation Higher Secondary School</h2>
        <p> Dr. Mrs.Umayal Ramanathan is the founder of Alagappa Matriculation Higher Secondary School.The necessity for setting up this institution arose in her mind when she thought of the Preparatory Students getting enrolled in the state stream of education. Our secretary's attention was focused in giving them an advanced stream of education namely the Matriculation stream. Now the school follows Samacheer Kalvi Syllabus prescribed by Government of Tamilnadu. Students are excelling in the academic career. </p>
        <p>Her ponderings came into reality by the opening of Alagappa Matriculation School in 1985 with an approximate strength of 60 students. Year by year the strength went on increasing coinciding with the up gradation of standards. In the year 1989 our first batch of students appeared for the Matriculation Examination. Then the Higher Secondary stream of education was introduced in 1990. Students were admitted for three different groups with the subject combination </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Maths , Physics, Chemistry, Biology.</li>
          <li>Maths, Physics, Chemistry, Computer Science.</li>
          <li>Commerce , Economics, Accountancy, Maths.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In the year 1992 the first set appeared for the Higher Secondary Examination. From 1997 onwards there has been a steady increase in the strength. Our school is located in the heart of the Karaikudi town. It has a sprawling campus of 15 acres. Our school has spacious and ventilated classrooms.Playgrounds with  Shady trees around which add beauty to our school campus. The school is governed by The Dr. Alagappa Chettiar Educational Trust. The Secretary of the Trust is Dr. (Mrs.) UMAYAL RAMANATHAN</p>
        <p>Alagappa Matriculation School has a wide and expansive campus with an excellent infrastructure. Athletics and Sports is given importance with other co-curricular activities.The school has well equipped laboratories for Physics, Chemistry, Computer Science and Biology. These are taken care of by skilled lab assistants. From this year onwards School has planned to introduce ROBOTICS with Central Governmet Tie up for our school children. Next year it will be upgraded as Space and in the third year as Aeronatics. The school is located in a serene atmosphere. It  also has separate modern hostels for Girls and boys.</p>
        <p>The school has a well equipped library ably managed by a librarian. To promote the aptitude in extensive reading among pupils weekly and monthly magazines, sports- journals and newspapers are procured for the library. A well qualified Arts and Crafts teacher is there to enhance creative thinking of the pupils and to draw out their innate talents. It is also the prime duty of a school to impart moral qualities and social responsibilities to the students. We have a regular schedule of school assembly which comprises of news reading, pledge, discourses by students themselves on various topics, Kural recital, mass drill and mass Bhajans etc.</p>
        <p>From the year 2009 the school has a strength of about 3000 students.
