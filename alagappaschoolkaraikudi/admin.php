There is no place for just rote learning and passive listening in the modern system of education. Current educational concepts reinforce the need to provide children with opportunities and situations which make them demonstrate their potential to the fullest. From a very young age, we must recognize leadership qualities in every child and nurture them by making learning both innovative and interesting. Children have vulnerable minds so it’s our responsibility to point them the right direction in life and develop their careers to best fit their potential and their personality. Every child is a unique so we need to teach and nurture them but at the same time we must identify and develop the individual skills and talents which make them unique.</p>
