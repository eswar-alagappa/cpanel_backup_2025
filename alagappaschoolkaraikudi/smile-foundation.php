<p>Smile Foundation is a national level development organization directly benefitting over 400,000 children and their families every year, through more than 200 live welfare projects on education, healthcare, livelihood and women empowerment, in over 950 remote villages and slums across 25 states of India.</p>
<p>Representative from SMILE FOUNDATION approached our school for the donation. As our founder Dr. RM. Alagappa Chettiar is a great philanthropist and has contributed his entire life for the cause of education and much more, our students also have been motivated to follow his foot prints. IX and XI standard students were given the privilege to contribute to Smile Foundation. They showed their magnanimity by donating more than 50,000 Rupees for the good cause.</p>
<p>The cheque was handed over by our hounourable chairman Thiru R. Vairavan to Ms.Preethi Assistant Manager CFC    of the SMILE FOUNDATION at Chennai. The organization awarded Gold, Silver and Bronze medal to the highest donors. The class teachers of the classes which contributed maximum, coordinators of the programme at school, and the principal were there when the cheque was handed over to the Smile Foundation.</p>
