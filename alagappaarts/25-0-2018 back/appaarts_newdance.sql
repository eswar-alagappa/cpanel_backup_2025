Cethaskritha Abhinaya is the movement of the entire body. Cethaskritha Abhinaya is further classified into two: gatipracara (expressive body movement) and nritta (pure dance movement). Gatipracara is also divided into two: Stithi (static posture) and Gati (movement leading to or away from a posture)\r\n\r\nIn Angika Abhinaya, the body is divided into three major parts: Anga, Pratyanga and Upanga.* The six Angas are Siras (head), Hasta (hand), Uras (chest), Parsva (sides), Kati (hips), and Pada (feet). Some people consider Greeva (neck) as Anga, too. There are six Pratyangas: Skandha (shoulders), Bahu (arms), Prstha (back), Jathara (stomatch), Uru (thighs), and Jangha (shanks). Some consider Manibandha (wrist), Kurpara (elbows) and Janu (knees) also as Pratyanga. There are seven Upangas or minor parts of the face which are important for facial expression. These are Netra (eyes), Bhru (eye-brows), Tara (pupil), Kapola (cheek), Nasika (nose), Adhara (lipa), and Cibuka (chin).\r\n\r\nAngika Abhinaya involves expressing the meaning of the song or lyrics using 	different body parts and is classified into two categories: expressions and body movement.

The folk dance kutthu performed in the streets during festivals was Tunangai. Pintherkuruvai specifically names the dance which was danced behind the chariot of kings who had won in battle.

Shaka means branch is refers to the hastas used. Ankura means sprout and refers to the usage of the hastas or the hasta vinyoga. And finally, nritta is pure dance movement and is the non-narrative part of dance. Angika Abhinaya is further subdivided into three categories depending on the part of the body being used. The categories are angas (major limbs), pratyangas (minor limbs), and Upangas (subsidiary limbs). The gestures are subdivided into mukhaja abhinaya (expression using the face), saria abhinaya (expression using the limbs), and cesthakritha abhinaya (movement of the entire body). Cesthakritha abhinaya is further subdivided into nritta which is pure dance movement and gati prachara. Gati prachara is expressive body movement and is made up of stithi or posture and gati or movement from the posture. \r\n\r\nThus with the above detailed classifications of body positions and movements, Natyashastra explains how emotions and behaviors can be conveyed through coordinations of all these body movements together.\r\n', 5, 1, 4),

In the first half of the 19th century the dance tradition was revitalized and defined anew through the contributions of four talented brothers (known today as the Tanjore Quartet): Chinniah, Sivanandam, Ponniah and Vadivelu. By coordinating their diverse talents, the four managed to organize all the basic dance movements of pure dance into a progressive series of lessons [adavu chapters]. Each adavu (basic unit of motion) was taught in systematic order and then combined with others to produce choreographed sequences based upon the rhythmic contour of a musical composition. In addition the brothers composed new music specifically for the dance, and introduced a different sequence of items which integrated the various aspects of dance and music into a carefully coordinated, aesthetically sound progression.

The Nattuvanar was called \"Thalaikol Asan\" The one who sang songs for dance was called \"Thoriya Madanthai\". \r\n\r\nNATTUVANGAM is a Tamil word i.e. Natta + Angam. Natta means dancer or Dance Performance and Angam means body or main operating or controlling centre. The combination of this two is called Nattuvangam. In other words a Dancer for presenting dance with aesthetic effect always tries to keep link with Nattuvangam. This effort by a dancer brings harmony for total attraction which ultimately leaves lasting effect in the mind audience. A good Nattuvangam is recognised by qualities like, melodious singing giving aesthetic effect to valuable meaning of words coming in song, keeping link with calculative and time bound rhythm, having soft and hard touch understanding in `sollukattu\' and creating harmony with expression by dancer through eyes and body languages and also powerful footwork with attractive choreography. Thus all such qualities are to be developed by a good Nattuvanar, who plays the Nattuvangam (Tattakali-Stick and wooden block) with melodious singing, controlling the tempo (laya) of the dance and conducting the dance orchestra. This is a very difficult task. He should have the knowledge of Music, Percussion and Literature. A good Nattuvangam does not need separate singing, but Nattuvanar himself is capable to sing perfectly creating harmony with dance performance and he is also very clear about Bha - Ra - Ta, means Bhava, Raga and Tala. Now a days such Nattuvanars are rare. Engaging a separate singer for dance performance in addition to Nattuvangam is nothing but creating the dirtiest adulteration in best qualitative performance of dance. A good singer without knowledge of dance is always trying to show his singing ability only which is always found in distorted condition for best performance of dance as he is not having any understanding of dance. The role of Nattuvanar is found similar to role played by a director in Films. The Director is not much exposed before spectators but his role is considered to be most valuable and effective. In the same way a good dance performance is possible only by an effective role of Nattuvanar. His work is involved right from the primary stage to final stage i.e. upto performance so far as Training and Shaping of a dancer is concerned.', 5, 1, 4),

Classifying Angika Abhinaya by the limbs that are used to express is one main method. Angas, Pratyangas, and Upangas are the three branches of limb movements. The second way that abhinaya can be classified is through the methods of expressing: Mukhaja, Sarira, and Ceshtakritha Abhinaya. Abhinaya can also be categorized into Shaka hastas, Ankura Hasta Prayoga, and Nritta.\r\n\r\nAngas are categorized as the six major limbs. These are the head, hands, chest, sides, waist, and feet. The movements of these parts are called Shiras (head), Uras (chest), Parsva (sides), Kati (waist), and Pada (feet) bhedas, as well as Hastas (hand gestures). Pratyangas are the postures of minor limbs, such as arms, shoulder blades, back, belly, thighs, and shank. Respectively, these movements are called Bahu, Skanda, Prstha, Jathara, Uru, and Jangha bedhas. Lastly, Upangas, or the movements of ancillary limbs are generally used to show fine or subtle expression with the eyes, eyebrows, pupils, nose, lips, cheeks, and chin. These delicate movements are called Netra, Bhru, Tara, Nasika, Adhara, Kapola, and Cibuka bhedas.\r\n\r\nThe different techniques of expressing Angika Abhinaya are Mukhaja, Sarira, and Ceshtakritha Abhinaya. Mukhaja Abhinaya, as the name suggests, is expression using the face. The most important element of Mukhaja Abhinaya is the used of eyes. As the word Sarira means body in Sanskrit, Sarira Abhinaya deals with the usage of the various limbs in the body to express or emote. Lastly, Ceshtakritha Abhinaya can be thought of as a combination of Mukhaja and Sarira Abhinaya. It is expression throughout the entire body. It has two aspects: Nritta, or pure footwork, and Gati Prachara, or expressive movements. Gati Prachara can be further split into Stithi (posture) and Gati (movement). \r\n\r\nAngika Abhinaya can also be divided into Shaka Hastas, Ankura Hasta Prayoga, and Nritta. Shaka, meaning branch, hastas encompass Samyutha, Asamyutha, and Nritta Hastas. Ankura Hasta Prayoga also has three subcategories: Hasta Pracara, Hasta Recaka, and Hasta Karana.

Next, Shranta can be used to show drooping eyes because of exhaustion. Glana (or Mlana) is very similar to Shranta. Lajjanvita and Trasta can both be used to show shyness or bashfulness. Shankita is a doubtful or skeptical glance, and Vishanna depicts depression or dejection. In contrast, Mukula is used to show taking pleasure in small or simple things. Kunchita is the glance in which the pupils are sunken and eyelashes are curved to give the impression of curved eyes. Abhitapta shows distress or sudden pain, and Jimha is the movement of the eyes from side to side in an obscure manner. Lalita is a graceful and sweet glance, while Vitarkita is used to show someone pondering or thinking. Ardhamukula is very similar to Mukula, except the eyelids half closed in this glance. In Vibhranta, the eyes are constantly in motion, and Vipluta is an even faster motion. They are used to show distraction or scattering. Akekara is used to show squinting, thus explaining the half closed eyelids. Lastly, Vikosha is simply a glance with wide open, unblinking eyes, but the pupils are not completely still.', 4, 1, 4),

One of thie highlights of the Brihadeeswara temple in Thanjavur is the sculptures of the Karanas. However, these are unique because the set is not complete.

On a more recent note, in 2010, Dr. Padma Subrahmanyam, the great Bharatanatyam exponent, gave a live performance in the temple with 1000 dancers on the occasion of the 1000th year of Brihadeeswara temple\'s construction.', 5, 1, 4),

However, light should not fall straight on top of the head because shade from the nose will fall on the lips, and shade from the forehead will fall on the eyes, giving the face a sunken appearance. Light needs to fall directly in front of the dancer, and foot lights should be avoided. Additionally, lights should not fall directly on the screen because the dancer\'s figure will not look bright in comparison. Spot lights, if used, should be kept high up and to the sides. Flood lights should be tied at an angle in front of the center spot as opposed to straight ahead.', 5, 1, 4),

If the movement involves only one leg, it is called a Chari, but if the dancer uses both legs for the motion, it is called a Karana. Further, a group of Karanas make up a Khanda and Khandas in triplets or quartets make up a Mandala. Charis have many uses in dance, including movement like releasing missiles, fighting, or histrionic representation. There are two types of Charis: Bhaumi (earthly) and Akasiki (aerial). In Bhaumi Charis, the feet are completely on the ground, while in Akasiki Charis, one or both feet are raised. Thus, Bhaumi Charis are inherently used for more rhythmic movements, and Akasiki Charis are used for delicate motions. Natyashastra and Abhinaya Darpana both describe Charis, but in different ways. While Natyashastra discusses 16 Bhaumi Charis and 16 Akasiki Charis.

The Nattuvanar is often times the guru. Next, the mridangam is an ancient percussion instrument from South India. The mridangist provides principal rhythmic accompaniment to the dancer during the concert. This enhances the dancer\'s footwork and closely follows the laya, or tempo, of the item.\r\n\r\nThe flute is a wind instrument made of bamboo. Through the adjustments in blowing strength and partial opening and closing of holes, playing the flute involve elaborate technique. The flute has a very unique quality that produces a melodious and pure sound. The veena is a plucked string instrument that involves using a plectrum to pluck the strings. The veena and flute both have several connections and symbolism in Hinduism. The violin is a string instrument made of hollow wood. It is played using a bow held in the right hand and the fingertips of the left hand. Together, the flute, veena, and violin provide melodious accompaniment to the singer, and add overall richness to the dance recital. Lastly, the tampura, or drone, is a string instrument that is used for shruthi.

(2317, 951, 340, 1076, 'Bharatanatyam is perhaps the oldest among the contemporary classical dance forms of India. It is an art which is mystical about itself and the search for understanding it in all totailty still continues. Dance has special mention in 2 important tamil works, Silappadigaram and Manimegalaiof the sangam age (500 B.C - 500 A.D). These sacred texts prescribed the mode of worship and referred to the consecration of dancing girls towards the service of the Gods. By the 10th century A.D., the Ardhamandali position (basic position) common to the classical dance was common to dance styles from Orissa to Gujarat and from Khajuraho to Trivandrum. The Pallava and chola rulers (4th to 12th centuries A.D) gave great stimulus to music and dance with the building of imposing temples in the south. This temple building tradition was kept alive by rulers, especially the Pandiyas, Nayak and the Marathas untill the end of 19th century. During the Maratha rule (A.D. 1674 - 1854) over Thanjavur, this dance art received considered filip. King Shahaji (1684 - 1711) wrote nearly 500 padams which are found in the form of palmleaf manuscript in Telugu script. King Tulaja II (1763 - 87) wrote the Sangitasaramrta, dealing with adavus (basic dance steps).\r\nDEVADASIS : Devadasis were found in TamilNadu and we find references to them in sacred text called Agama Sastras (principles of temple building). The word Devadasi has the meaning embedded in its own, Deva - God and Dasi - Servant which frames them as \"Servant of God\". The institution of Devadasis, servants of God, contributed in being responsible for preserving the art. They would perform during temple worship, delighting the audiences with charming stories from our mythologies. They were supported by the temple funds and became part of the sanctum sanctorum of the temple. In the beautiful Natya-Mandapas (dance halls), Praharas (Pathways) and Garbagraha (sanctum sanctorum) the dance dramas, ritualistic dances and the devotional numbers were done by the devadasis as offering to the presiding deities. They dedicated themselves to the service of God through their music and dance and were known as Devaradiyar (Servant of God). \r\nThe dancers were of three types:\r\n1. Devadasi - who danced in front of the deity in the temple\r\n2. Rajadasi - who danced in the courts of kings\r\n3. Alanakaradasi - who danced at the weddings. \r\nDASIATTAM : A sysytem of presentation of dance developed, in which there was only a single dancer, and the dance came to be known as Dasiattam.

Alagappa Chettiar. The primary objective of APAA is to propagate the exquisite practice of Indian art and culture in their pristine purity and in conformance to tradition.</p><p>APAA in its maiden venture has focused on Bharathanatyam, an art that combines artistic expression, vigorous dancing with a sense of spirituality. Students of Bharathanatyam spend years learning the art and perfecting the practice to perform the ‘Arangetram” which is a graduation performance. A student might typically take about 5 to 7 years to perform an Arangetram. If a student were to pursue graduate studies during this time a student should be able to complete post-graduate education. However in pursuit of learning Bharathanatyam, dancers are not awarded degrees or certification for their accomplishment.</p><p>APAA in an effort to fulfill this need has developed a structured learning program, using eminent artistes in the field and designed a comprehensive curriculum in performing arts to demonstrate the repertoire of culture that is embedded in these classical arts. The programs have been designed with specific course work and practicals that a student has to successfully complete to get the respective certification. Effective detailed aids have been developed to enhance the learning process with the comprehensive review of the various aspects of the art. From an overview of the various dances in India , to the rudiments of dancing, to clearly depicting the exquisite language of gestures, postures and rhythmical delivery, a student is guided through the various phases of this intricate art with textbooks that concisely explain its relevance and interactive DVDs that vividly describe the precise execution of the art. These valuable learning aids enhance the comprehension and make this a valuable exercise for students to understand the depth and versatility of this art with theory and practicals integrated in a format similar to academic programs.</p><p>The teaching aids will initially focus on Bharathanatyam and supplemental aids will be added to other classical dance forms of India such as Mohini Attam, Odissi, Kuchipudi, Kathak and Manipuri. These programs are offered through APAA Authorized Certification Centers (APACs) worldwide to enable students to obtain an undergraduate and post graduate degrees in performing arts. The vision of APAA is to obtain accreditation for this program from renowned Universities in the world, propagate and bring prominence not only to Indian performing arts but also to all other dance and music art forms by offering structured learning programs to students worldwide.</p>	</div>', 1, 'Super Admin', 'Super Admin', '2015-12-31 13:41:28', '2016-01-07 10:27:56'),

The name ‘Bharathanatyam’ is derived from three basic concepts of Bhava, Raga and Thaala. The dance is performed on the stage as Nritham, Nrithyam and Natyam. Bharathanatyam is based on the theories of the books ‘Natyasaasthram* and ‘Abhinaya Darpanam’. The dance form is based on ‘Adavus’ (steps) and ‘Hasthamudra’ (hand gestures). There are 64 basic ‘Adavu’s and they are divided into 9 parts, of which ‘Thattadavu’, ‘Naatadavu’, ‘Kuthithumettadavu’, ‘Mandiadavu’, ‘Sarikkal’ and ‘Thattumettu’ are very important. Communication is done through ‘Bhavabhinaya’ (facial expression) and ‘Hasthamudra’ (hand gestures).</p><p>The sequence of a dance performance is ‘Alarippu’, ‘Jathiswaram’, ‘Sabdam’, ‘Varnam’, ‘Padam’ and ‘Thillana’. After Thillana’, with a ‘Mangala Slokam’ the dance program ends. Normally the performance lasts for two to two and half hours. Dancers wear traditional costumes consisting of specially made saris, jewelry and hair ornaments and specifically applied facial and body make-up. The dancers wear a lot of ornaments of shining stones on neck, ears, hands and head, jasmine garland in the hair and foot trinket with small bells.</p><p>The music of Bharathanatyam is based on Carnatic classical music. The instruments used are Veena, Flute, Mridangam and Violin. The dance direction is done by ‘Nattuvanar’ giving the Talam using hand symbols and singing ‘Vaaythari’. Generally there will be two singers. Because of its intricacy and specificity, Bharathanatyam can be used to enact any story in any language.</p>	</div>', 1, 'Super Admin', 'Super Admin', '2016-01-07 11:12:02', '2016-01-07 11:12:11'),

(23, 'sssss', '<div class=\\\"apaaContent\\\"> 		 <p>Three millennia ago, Bharata wrote an exhaustive treatise on the three prominent arts of dance in inordinate detail.</p><p>Bharathanatyam is a classical dance style of Southern India that combines artistic expression with a sense of spirituality. The name ‘Bharathanatyam’ is derived from three basic concepts of Bhava, Raga and Thaala. The dance is performed on the stage as Nritham, Nrithyam and Natyam. Bharathanatyam is based on the theories of the books ‘Natyasaasthram* and ‘Abhinaya Darpanam’. The dance form is based on ‘Adavus’ (steps) and ‘Hasthamudra’ (hand gestures). There are 64 basic ‘Adavu’s and they are divided into 9 parts, of which ‘Thattadavu’, ‘Naatadavu’, ‘Kuthithumettadavu’, ‘Mandiadavu’, ‘Sarikkal’ and ‘Thattumettu’ are very important. Communication is done through ‘Bhavabhinaya’ (facial expression) and ‘Hasthamudra’ (hand gestures).</p><p>The sequence of a dance performance is ‘Alarippu’, ‘Jathiswaram’, ‘Sabdam’, ‘Varnam’, ‘Padam’ and ‘Thillana’. After Thillana’, with a ‘Mangala Slokam’ the dance program ends. Normally the performance lasts for two to two and half hours. Dancers wear traditional costumes consisting of specially made saris, jewelry and hair ornaments and specifically applied facial and body make-up. The dancers wear a lot of ornaments of shining stones on neck, ears, hands and head, jasmine garland in the hair and foot trinket with small bells.</p><p>The music of Bharathanatyam is based on Carnatic classical music. The instruments used are Veena, Flute, Mridangam and Violin. The dance direction is done by ‘Nattuvanar’ giving the Talam using hand symbols and singing ‘Vaaythari’. Generally there will be two singers. Because of its intricacy and specificity, Bharathanatyam can be used to enact any story in any language.</p>	</div>', 1, 'Super Admin', 'Super Admin', '2016-03-04 11:18:25', '2016-03-04 11:19:29'),
