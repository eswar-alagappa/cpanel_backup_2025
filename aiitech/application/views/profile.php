<h4>OUR MISSION</h4>
<p>Our mission is to provide a wide spectrum of educational programs representing the latest in information technology that are beneficial to our students and the community to enhance their skill set and to enable them to meet the growing needs of the industry.</p>
<h4>OUR RICH HERITAGE</h4>
<p>Dr. RM. Alagappa Chettiar was a visionary who believed that education was an absolute necessity for a human being to become productive, wholesome and humane. Responding to the then Prime Minister Pandit Jawaharlal Nehruâ€™s call to industrialists to set up educational institutions, he was quick to set up a cluster of educational institutions which today form the core of the Alagappa University in Karaikudi.</p>
<p>A host of eminent personalities from Prime Minister Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, to Presidents of India, Dr. Rajendra Prasad and Dr. S. Radhakrishnan, to industrialists and royalty such as the Mysore Maharajah, have graced the inauguration of various Alagappa Institutions with their presence.</p>
<p>AIT, located in the heart of the Alagappa Schools campus in Chennai was officially inaugurated on 19th  November, 1999 by the then Education Minister of Tamil Nadu Prof. Anbazhagan and has since emerged as a Centre of Excellence in education.</p>

After a successful roll out, ERP applications offer a variety of returns on the initial investment. Benefits might include more efficient business processes, tighter cost controls, and better customer service. However, these gains do not happen overnight.
