This is certainly the shortest way to promote your web site in the TOP 10. According to our 17 year experience, using our SEO methods and strategies, average advance period in TOP-10 search engines is about 3-6 months (high-frequency queries), and with the integrated promotion of the site it will be in the top 10 search engines (some requests) within 2-3 weeks.
