Subject: This is why small businesses are far more susceptible to cyberattacks

Message Body:
Barracuda reports that companies with fewer than 100 employees are 350% more likely to suffer social engineering attacks than their enterprise counterparts.

Small businesses frequently spend less on IT security than they should. They believe that purchasing an antivirus application provides sufficient protection. With the growth of technology to the cloud, however, this is but one layer. Proper security requires much more.

Recent studies have shown that the average cost of a data breach to small businesses can range from $120,000 to $1.24 million, and that’s strictly limited to a small business market.

NetResults Technology Group is a full-service managed service provider that offers unlimited remote support, onsite and hosted e-mail, onsite and remote backup services, managed services, security, disaster recovery, hosted servers, cloud computing, Authorized G Suite, and Office365 Reseller. We treat every client as an extension of our staff and have a quick response time with accountability.

Cybersecurity is no longer a luxury, it’s a necessity for businesses.

May I give you more information on our full line of managed services?

Thank you for your time,

Todd Wexler
