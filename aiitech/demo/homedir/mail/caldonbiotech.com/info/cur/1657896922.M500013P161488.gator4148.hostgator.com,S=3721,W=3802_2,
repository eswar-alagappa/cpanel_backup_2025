Hi Fareed,

My team came across a fantastic Finance expert who is among the most impres=
sive professionals that I have seen (I thought that you would like to take =
a look).

This Chief Financial Officer has performed comprehensive analysis for the a=
nnual budget of $10M with careful consideration of key financial indicators=
 and advised CEO with development of business strategies, financial models,=
 and strategic revenue stream development. Additionally, he has reviewed fi=
scal policies and procedures and internal control system, updated as deemed=
 appropriate, and coordinated annual audit and tax filing with external aud=
itor and county auditors. Seasoned at Financial Reporting and Account Recon=
ciliation, he also has Tax Reporting expertise. Our recruitment specialists=
 noted that this leader maintained general ledger and all monthly, quarterl=
y, and annual closings and supervised all accounting practices, including r=
evenue analysis, cash flows, and payables and receivables and managed inter=
nal procedures for monitoring of grant awards and work plans for compliance=
 and ensured compliance with reimbursement protocols and procedures for fun=
ders were met.

Are you impressed with this professional...or should we keep looking, Faree=
d? I am interested to know about the type of talent you need. Let's discuss=
 your specific hiring requirements...Tuesday at 9:10am?

Regards,
Roberta
