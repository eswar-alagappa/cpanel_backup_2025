Hi Fareed,

Hiring qualified R&D talent is hard. Picking your next great hire becomes m=
ore challenging when you have an overabundance of job board resumes to sort=
 through. You don't need more possibilities. You need the best candidate. S=
omeone like this:

This Associate Manager of Analytical Research and Development reviewed and =
approved analytical data for certificate of analysis for finished product r=
aw material release. Additionally created, reviewed and approved change con=
trols, deviations, CAPAs and investigations as well as led project teams fo=
r new drug products launching and is an expert in Regulatory Affairs Manage=
ment, FDA and Pharmacovigilance.

We should chat if receiving a list of qualified, handpicked candidates at a=
 low cost interests you. Would you be available for a chat on Wednesday at =
11am?

Steph
