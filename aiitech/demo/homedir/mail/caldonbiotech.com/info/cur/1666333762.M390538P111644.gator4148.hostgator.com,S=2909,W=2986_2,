This message was created automatically by mail delivery software.

    Delay reason: host lookup for eig-west.smtp.a.cloudfilter.net did not complete (DNS timeout?)

No action is required on your part. Delivery attempts will continue for
some time, and this warning may be repeated at intervals if the message
remains undelivered. Eventually the mail delivery software will give up,
and when that happens, the message will be returned to you.
