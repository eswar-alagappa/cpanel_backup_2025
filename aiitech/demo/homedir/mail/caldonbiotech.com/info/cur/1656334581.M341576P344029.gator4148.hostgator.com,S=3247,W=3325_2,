Hi Fareed,

Hiring is stressful enough without adding in a recruiter that is hard to wo=
rk with.

It is important to Matchfield to get it right. We do not push you to hire c=
andidates that you are not keen on. I'd like to get a feel for what type of=
 talent you are looking for. What are your thoughts on this candidate?

This Senior Maintenance Technician wrote, reviewed and approved CAPAs and Q=
A investigation reports, standard operation procedures and formal reports. =
My firm noted that he also created the infrastructure for metrology instrum=
entation, as well as validated IQ/OQ/PQ scripts as per approved protocol. T=
his professional has expertise in Calibration, SCADA and Metrology.

Let's chat if you want to work with a recruiter that truly listens. Are you=
 available for 10 min at 10am on Wednesday?

Steph

P.S. Matchfield's upfront flat-fee pricing offers you incredible value.
