This message was created automatically by mail delivery software.
A message that you sent has not yet been delivered to one or more of its
recipients after more than 192 hours on the queue on gator4148.hostgator.com.

The message identifier is:     1oeWb0-002Ms8-Lc
The subject of the message is: caldonbiotech.com,465,info@caldonbiotech.com,Info@123
The date of the message is:    Sat, 1 Oct 2022 10:07:16 +0300

The address to which the message has not yet been delivered is:

  jasmineeugeniusjohan@gmail.com
    Delay reason: host lookup for eig-east.smtp.a.cloudfilter.net did not complete (DNS timeout?)

No action is required on your part. Delivery attempts will continue for
some time, and this warning may be repeated at intervals if the message
remains undelivered. Eventually the mail delivery software will give up,
and when that happens, the message will be returned to you.
