Hi Fareed,

This excellent Sales leader is generating a lot of buzz... I thought it wou=
ld be a good idea to send over some professional achievements, in case hiri=
ng needs are on the horizon.

This Vice President of Business Development generated 2 RFPs per month in t=
he mid to high 6 figures with potential multi-year Collaborative Agreements=
=2E My firm was also impressed that he overhauled sales strategy and put in=
 place an effective go-to-market plan, as well as managed strategic allianc=
es between partners across the globe resulting in more than 200 commerciali=
zed finished dose formulations. This leader is an expert in Marketing Strat=
egy, Forecasting, and Channel Development.

Thoughts, Fareed? I would love to discuss this executive with you - or any =
other hiring priorities you have (permanent and clinical contracting). A br=
ief phone call might be easiest. How about Tuesday at 11:05am?

Regards,
Roberta

P.S. I want you to experience working with Sterling Life Sciences, so I'm o=
ffering you a 15% Placement fee on permanent hires when you provide your se=
arch details by December 30, 2022.
