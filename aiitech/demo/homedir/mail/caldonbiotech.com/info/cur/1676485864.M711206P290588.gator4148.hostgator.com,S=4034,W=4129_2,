Hi Fareed,

This excellent Medical Affairs talent is generating a lot of buzz... I thou=
ght it would be a good idea to send over some professional achievements, in=
 case hiring needs are on the horizon.

This Senior Medical Officer conceptualized innovative initiatives to suppor=
t marketing strategy while ensuring that all projects were accurate and met=
 program objectives. Additionally, he interacted with healthcare profession=
als on programs to meet strategic objectives through advocacy developments,=
 use of medical marketing rationale identification, and selection of approp=
riate healthcare professionals. Seasoned at Medical Affairs and Clinical Re=
search, he also has Pharmaceutical Industry expertise. This highly skilled =
executive medically directed projects for assigned products and group super=
vision of associate medical directors and medical writers.

Thoughts, Fareed? I would love to discuss this professional with you - or a=
ny other hiring priorities you have (permanent and contract). A brief phone=
 call might be easiest. How about Tuesday at 9:25am?

Regards,
Roberta
