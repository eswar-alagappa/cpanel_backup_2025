Subject: Hiring leadership talent? Fareed, let's talk...

Hi Fareed,

Do you have 5 minutes to discuss your upcoming permanent or contract hiring=
 needs? I'm asking because we're in touch with some fantastic leadership ta=
lent previously with Baxter, Amgen and Pfizer that I think may pique your i=
nterest.

Are you available on Tuesday at 10:30am? Drop me a line to let me know what=
 works best for your schedule.

Regards,
Roberta
