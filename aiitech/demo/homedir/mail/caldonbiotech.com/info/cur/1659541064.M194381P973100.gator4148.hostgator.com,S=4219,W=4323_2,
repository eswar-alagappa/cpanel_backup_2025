Hi Fareed,

Just thought I'd reach out today to see if you had the chance to take a loo=
k at Chief Commercial Officer and Vice President of Marketing and Fund Deve=
lopment profiles that I had sent? I'll get straight to the point, these pro=
fessionals are in demand right now, so I want to make sure that you can pre=
view their credentials sooner rather than later.

Are you available for a quick call Friday @ 11:30am?

-Kathryn
