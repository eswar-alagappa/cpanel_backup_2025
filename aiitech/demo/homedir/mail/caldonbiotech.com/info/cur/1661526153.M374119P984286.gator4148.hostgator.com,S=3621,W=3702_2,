Fareed,

This Regulatory Affairs expert has made a fantastic impression on our firm =
and I thought that you'd be interested in taking a sneak peek at her achiev=
ements (if you are looking to hire, of course).

This Vice President of Regulatory Affairs developed clinical and regulatory=
 department budgets, schedules and performance standards and directed the t=
eam accordingly. Additionally, this executive planned clinical trial resour=
cing and provided oversight to achieve program objectives and high-quality =
deliverables within established timelines and budgets, as well as created a=
nd allocated adequate resources to support global regulatory affairs and cl=
inical trial strategies and is an expert in Strategic Planning, Risk Manage=
ment and Clinical Study Design.

So....what are your thoughts, Fareed? If you are interested in learning mor=
e about this VP - or other great leadership talent on our roster, I would l=
ove to discuss. Are you available for a 5-7 minute phone call on Tuesday at=
 9:40am re: your hiring needs?

Regards,
Roberta
