Hi Fareed,

My recruiters are in touch with an incredible Finance leader and I wanted t=
o fill you in on some details in case he would be a fit for a current role.

This Chief Financial Officer has performed a comprehensive analysis of the =
annual budget of $10M with careful consideration of key financial indicator=
s and advised the CEO on the development of business strategies, financial =
models, and strategic revenue stream development. Additionally, he has revi=
ewed fiscal policies and procedures and the internal control system, update=
d it as deemed appropriate, and coordinated annual audit and tax filing wit=
h the external auditor and county auditors. Seasoned at Financial Reporting=
 and Account Reconciliation, he also has Tax Reporting expertise. Our recru=
itment specialists noted that this leader maintained the general ledger and=
 all monthly, quarterly, and annual closings and supervised all accounting =
practices, including revenue analysis, cash flows, and payables and receiva=
bles and managed internal procedures for monitoring grant awards and work p=
lans for compliance and ensured compliance with reimbursement protocols and=
 procedures for funders were met.

Are you impressed with this professional...or should we keep looking, Faree=
d? I am interested to know about the type of talent you need. Let's discuss=
 your specific hiring requirements...Wednesday at 11:20am?

Regards,
Roberta
