Hi, dear user of caldonbiotech.com

We have installed one RAT software into you device 
For this moment your email account is hacked too.

Changed your password? You're doing great!
But my software recognizes every such action. I'm updating passwords!
I'm always one step ahead....

So... I have downloaded all confidential information from your system and I got some more evidence.
The most interesting moment that I have discovered are videos records where you masturbating.

I posted EternalBlue Exploit modification on porn site, and then you installed my malicious code (trojan) on your operation system.
When you clicked the button Play on porn video, at that moment my trojan was downloaded to your device.
After installation, your front camera shoots video every time you masturbate, in addition, the software is synchronized with the video you choose.

For the moment, the software has harvrested all your contact information from social networks and email addresses.
If you need to erase all of your collected data and video with your enjoy, send me $600(usd) in BTC (crypto currency).

This is my Bitcoin wallet: 1A19CzQQ5ZFxK57LWoAn2rFScTda6DnK1q
You have 48 hours after reading this letter.

After your transaction I will erase all your data.
Otherwise, I will send video with your pranks to all your colleagues, friends and relatives!!!

P.S. I'm asking you - not to answer this letter because the sender's address is fake, just to keep me incognito.

And henceforth be more careful!
Please visit only secure sites!
Bye,Bye...
