Hi=20

I hope you are well.

As you may have noticed from my previous emails, Caldon Biotech has
been placed forward by Global Health & Pharma as a potential
nominee in the 8th annual Biotechnology Awards, established to
honour the most innovative, hardworking companies within the
industry.

At this stage, we kindly require a decision regarding whether you
would like to join the shortlist or not. Therefore, if you could
kindly inform me of your choice via one of the following
responses that would be great:

Accept Nomination ( http://response.ghp-news.com/Response/Positive/?emailAd=
dress=3Dcustomersupport%40caldonbiotech.com&publication=3DGlobal+Health+%26=
+Pharma&contactIdentifier=3De923c9d7-b94b-48a2-b82a-5a179495bd53 )

the process, even if you do go on to be successful! We offer
everyone who is successful in our awards a complimentary package,
that can be used on its own or alongside our supplementary
