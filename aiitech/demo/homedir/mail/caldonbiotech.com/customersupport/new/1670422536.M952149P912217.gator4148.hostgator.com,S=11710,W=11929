Hi=20

By now I hope you are aware that Caldon Biotech has been placed forward
as a nominee by Global Health & Pharma in the eighth
annual Biotechnology Awards 2023.

At this stage we believe you would make an excellent candidate
for the awards and would like to invite your participation prior
to the upcoming submissions deadline.

It would be great to know whether Caldon Biotech would like to continue
to our shortlist and be in contention to receive one of our
industry recognised accolades (or not!)

Please let us know your preference for moving forwards from the
following options:

A =E2=80=93 Accept Nomination & Join Shortlist (
http://response.ghp-news.com/Response/Positive/?emailAddress=3Dcustomersupp=
ort%40caldonbiotech.com&publication=3DGlobal+Health+%26+Pharma&contactIdent=
ifier=3De923c9d7-b94b-48a2-b82a-5a179495bd53 )

B =E2=80=93 Request more information from the Nominations Team by
replying to this email

al+Health+%26+Pharma&contactIdentifier=3De923c9d7-b94b-48a2-b82a-5a179495bd=
53 )

Once a nomination is accepted, you=E2=80=99ll be moved across to our
shortlist and sent across an optional questionnaire, should you
wish to provide any supporting evidence (completely optional).
Many nominees enjoy sharing the nomination at this stage so feel
free to do so!

Taking part in the Biotechnology Awards 2023 is not only the
perfect chance to compete with industry leaders across the global
Biotech landscape; it is also a great way to show the belief you
have in the hard work and dedication of those you work alongside.

Successful awardees will be welcome to utilise a complimentary
package of items to showcase their award, as well as a range of
bespoke paid-for packages which will always remain completely
optional.

If you=E2=80=99d like any further details on your nomination or how
participation in our awards can be beneficial then please feel
free to get in touch with myself (Emma) or one of my colleagues =E2=80=93
Emily and Linsey. You can give us a call on +44 (0) 203 725
6847 or drop us an email if preferred!

I very much look forward to hearing from you.
