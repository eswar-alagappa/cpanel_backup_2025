In an attempt to put some time on your calendar, I'm following up on the
voicemail I left. Do you have 15 free minutes next week on Wednesday at 2
PM?

Thanks,

Hi Gloria=E2=80=8B,

Staffing and recruiting uncertainty are among the top pandemic challenges
for organizations across North America. In a recent survey of organizations
across North America, the top 3 responses when asking about recruiting and
staffing:

   - We can=E2=80=99t find enough workers to staff our business.
   - No one wants to work anymore.
   - I can=E2=80=99t get anyone to show up.
   - Top talent is exiting out the door faster than we can replace them.
