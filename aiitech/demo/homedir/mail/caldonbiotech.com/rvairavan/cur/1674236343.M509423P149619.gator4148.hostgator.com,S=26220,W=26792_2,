Use of whole blood real-time PCR testing to diagnose early Lyme disease (h=
ttps://www.captodayonline.com/clinical-pathology-selected-abstracts-0123/)
------------------------------------------------------------

Borrelia burgdorferi is the leading cause of Lyme disease in the United St=
ates=2C with approximately 35=2C000 new cases reported to the CDC each yea=
r. The agency recommends a two-tiered approach to testing. The first tier=
 is a sensitive enzyme immunoassay (EIA) targeting B. burgdorferi antibodi=
es and the second is an immunoblot specific for immunoglobulin M (IgM) or=
 immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies. However=2C orthogonal EIA in a modifie=
d two-tiered testing (MTTT) algorithm can replace the second tier of testi=
ng. The two-tiered approach to Lyme disease diagnosis has a sensitivity of=
 66 to 78 percent and specificity of 95 to 99 percent. Direct molecular te=
sting for B. burgdorferi DNA in whole blood also has high specificity for=
 early Lyme disease diagnosis=2C but spirochetemia in early Lyme disease u=
sually lasts only several days after infection. The authors conducted a st=
udy to assess the impact of concurrent molecular and serologic testing for=
 early Lyme disease and determine the utility of whole
blood real-time polymerase chain reaction (WB-RTPCR) in assisting with the=
 diagnosis.

Neurofilament light chain=2C a biomarker of neuronal injury=2C is elevated=
 in several neurodegenerative diseases=2C including Alzheimer disease and=
 multiple sclerosis=2C and in acute concussion. Patients receiving an infu=
sion of cellular products are at risk for neuronal injury and may develop=
 immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS). Approxima=
tely 40 to 60 percent of patients will develop ICANS after chimeric antige=
n receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy.

</h2>

<p style=3D"text-align: left;"><em>Borrelia burgdorferi</em> is the leadin=
g cause of Lyme disease in the United States=2C with approximately 35=2C00=
0 new cases reported to the CDC each year. The agency recommends a two-tie=
red approach to testing. The first tier is a sensitive enzyme immunoassay=
 (EIA) targeting <em>B. burgdorferi</em> antibodies and the second is an i=
mmunoblot specific for immunoglobulin M (IgM) or immunoglobulin G (IgG) an=
tibodies. However=2C orthogonal EIA in a modified two-tiered testing (MTTT=
) algorithm can replace the second tier of testing. The two-tiered approac=
h to Lyme disease diagnosis has a sensitivity of 66 to 78 percent and spec=
ificity of 95 to 99 percent. Direct molecular testing for <em>B. burgdorfe=
ri</em> DNA in whole blood also has high specificity for early Lyme diseas=
e diagnosis=2C but spirochetemia in early Lyme disease usually lasts only=
 several days after infection. The authors conducted a study to assess the=
 impact of concurrent molecular and serologic testing for early Lyme disea=
se and determine the utility of whole blood real-time polymerase chain rea=
ction (WB-RTPCR) in assisting with the diagnosis.</p>
