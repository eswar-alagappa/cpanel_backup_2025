 was a committee whose work I knew little about but which I quickly grew t=

 not just fix them. This focus on process was different from the focus on=

An international group of scientists and clinicians identified the molecul=

 databases as MyGene2=2C GeneMatcher=2C and Matchmaker Exchange=2C which m=
