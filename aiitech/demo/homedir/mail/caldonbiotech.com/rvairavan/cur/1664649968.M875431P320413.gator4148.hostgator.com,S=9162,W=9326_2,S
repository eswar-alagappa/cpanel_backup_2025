Hi,

I am Fahad Hassen and I work as a Google Business Profile consultant, and I
am interested in helping caldonbiotech.com to rank on the 1st page of
Google. As you might already know, Google Business Profile program from
Google is for listing local businesses, which will then be shown on Google
for the relevant searches made in the local area.

Issue with your listing is, you will appear to rank #1 when you search it
from your location - but just 500m away, you are nowhere to be seen. The
reason for this is because the strength of the Google Business Profile is
not enough - you will need more reviews, more external articles relevant to
your business (not the classic backlinks), more activity in terms of Posts,
Questions and Answers and a lot more.

I see that you have listed a phone number on the homepage of your website,
but you have not setup the following correctly.
 * Google My Business secondary listing categories.
 * The review system setup, which contributes to ranking.
 * Citations issues with incosistency.

Once these are setup well, you will rank on the first page of Google for
searches made within 2km of your business location, from any side of your
business address, to start with. You can extend the coverage as your
profile grows. If you wish to hide your address, you can do that too but
you must first submit an address to Google to gain a ranking advantage.

With Google Local listings algorithm, it is fairly easy to rank for any
local business within 2km, with the right setup, within 24 hours. This is
because you are only competing with similar businesses in the local area,
as opposed to competing nationally. You can also cover a larger area in
terms of ranking, but it requires a solid plan of citations and about 4
weeks.

Not sure if you understand everything that I have mentioned on this email,
but let me know if you are interested and I'll send you an illustration on
how your competitors are ranking and you are missing out the easy
opportunity.

Fahad Hassen
-Google Local Guide
-Senior PHP Developer

* Upon interest, I'll provide my full contact details, regarding official
URLs, full contact details and past work.
* I am working for Google as an official Local Guide, assisting with Google
Local Search.
* This service I provide to you is independent from Google, and I provide
you an illustration for you at no cost. In case you are interested in
learning more after looking at the illustration, I will present you with my
service offers, which could be as low as $50. In case you have no interest,
I will be still thankful for you to let me send you the illustration to
have a look :)
* May I send you the illustration? Yes/No? Thanks.
