 Hi Gloria=E2=80=8B,

Staffing and recruiting uncertainty are among the top pandemic challenges
for organizations across North America. In a recent survey of organizations
across North America, the top 3 responses when asking about recruiting and
staffing:

   - We can=E2=80=99t find enough workers to staff our business.
   - No one wants to work anymore.
   - I can=E2=80=99t get anyone to show up.
   - Top talent is exiting out the door faster than we can replace them.

Book a meeting with me

or reply to this email, if you find yourself saying any of these things.
During the severe labor shortage of 2021 & 2022, Eastridge has dramatically
increased our weekly candidate engagement by over 300%. We have invested
more resources than ever in our people, processes, and technology to drive
candidate engagement and fill our client's open positions faster. I have
numerous candidates available now in Las Vegas that are ready to be
deployed at your organization.

Thanks,
Milena=E2=80=8B
