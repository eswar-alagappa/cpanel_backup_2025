Genetic testing for people with spontaneous coronary artery dissection (ht=
tps://www.captodayonline.com/molecular-pathology-abstracts-1122/)
------------------------------------------------------------
Spontaneous coronary artery dissection is an uncommon cause of acute heart=
 attack. It is not associated with high cholesterol or atherosclerosis but=
=2C instead=2C occurs when a small tear or separation in the wall of the c=
oronary artery leads to blood entering a false lumen=2C occluding blood fl=
ow and impairing oxygenation of the heart muscle. The condition is most of=
ten seen in young women=2C and it is thought to have a number of underlyin=
g etiologies and risk factors. Some cases of spontaneous coronary artery d=
issection (SCAD) are thought to have a monogenic etiology caused by pathog=
enic alterations in genes associated with connective tissue diseases=2C su=
ch as Ehlers-Danlos syndrome=2C Marfan syndrome=2C and Loeys-Dietz syndrom=
e=2C as well as fibrillar collagen disorders.


** Clinical utility of genomic testing in metastatic breast cancer (https:=
//www.captodayonline.com/molecular-pathology-abstracts-1122/)
------------------------------------------------------------
Precision medicine in oncology is rapidly becoming a standard of care. Nex=
t-generation sequencing assays increasingly are being used to identify mut=
ations in oncogenes and tumor-suppressor genes that could potentially impa=
ct cancer treatment decisions. Targeted therapies or clinical trials are a=
vailable for some alterations=2C but clinicians typically are unsure of ho=
w to address the others. Several tiered systems have been developed to cla=
ssify variants identified using clinical assays and to highlight those wit=
h strong or potential clinical significance. Among them are the Associatio=
n for Molecular Pathology/American Society of Clinical Oncology/College of=
 American Pathologists (AMP/ASCO/CAP) tiered system=2C European Society of=
 Medical Oncology Scale for Clinical Actionability of Molecular Targets (E=
SCAT) classification system=2C and OncoKB system=2C developed by Memorial=
 Sloan Kettering Cancer Center.
