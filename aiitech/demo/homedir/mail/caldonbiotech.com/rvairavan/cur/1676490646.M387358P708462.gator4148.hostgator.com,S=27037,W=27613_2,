Color Atlas of Flow Cytometry. It consists of 71 cases and provides exampl=

** Ins and outs of von Willebrand factor activity assays (https://www.capt=
odayonline.com/ins-and-outs-of-von-willebrand-factor-activity-assays/)
------------------------------------------------------------
Guidelines for the diagnosis of von Willebrand disease=2C published in 202=
1=2C have raised questions about which von Willebrand factor activity assa=
y laboratories should use. Each has its strengths and weaknesses=2C and th=
e FDA has cleared or approved some=2C but not all=2C of the newer automate=
d assays. In addition=2C not all the assays or guidelines use the same act=
ivity-to-antigen ratio cutoff to discriminate type 1 from type 2 von Wille=
brand disease=2C making it difficult to compare accuracy.

=E2=80=9CThat just begins the challenge=2C=E2=80=9D said Marian Rollins-Ra=
val=2C MD=2C MPH=2C associate professor of pathology at the University of=
 New Mexico and medical director=2C TriCore Special Coagulation Laboratory=
=2C speaking in a CAP22 session about the five major types of von Willebra=
nd factor (VWF) activity assays. Then=2C too=2C more clinical studies eval=
uating the newer assays and comparing them with the original ristocetin co=
factor assays are needed=2C said co-presenter Neil Harris=2C MD=2C clinica=
l professor of pathology=2C immunology=2C and laboratory medicine at the U=
niversity of Florida. Drs. Rollins-Raval and Harris are members of the CAP=
 Hemostasis and Thrombosis Committee.

When assessing a patient with a bleeding tendency for von Willebrand disea=
se (VWD)=2C Dr. Harris said=2C start with a CBC=2C =E2=80=9Cbecause it cou=
ld be a thrombocytopenia.=E2=80=9D Prothrombin time and partial prothrombi=
n time should be measured because PT is not prolonged in VWD. =E2=80=9CYou=
=E2=80=99ll want to look at fibrinogen and possibly the thrombin time as w=
ell=2C=E2=80=9D he said. If results of all are normal or there=E2=80=99s a=
n isolated prolonged PTT=2C =E2=80=9Cyou want to do the initial VWF screen=
ing assays=2C=E2=80=9D which include VWF antigen=2C VWF activity=2C and fa=
ctor VIII activity. If one or more of these tests are abnormal=2C the pati=
ent should be referred for selected specialized VWD studies=2C including v=
on Willebrand multimeric analysis.

 flow cytometry cases in new color atlas</a></h2>
                   Due out this spring is the CAP=E2=80=99s <em>Color Atla=
s of Flow Cytometry</em>. It consists of 71 cases and provides examples of=
 the full range of hematolymphoid diseases that can be productively analyz=
ed by flow cytometric immunophenotyping. Its editors are David Dorfman=2C=
 MD=2C PhD; William Karlon=2C MD=2C PhD; and Michael Linden=2C MD=2C PhD.=
 CAP TODAY recently asked Dr. Dorfman a few questions about the atlas.

Guidelines for the diagnosis of von Willebrand disease=2C published in 202=
