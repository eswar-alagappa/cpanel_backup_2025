Non-destructive inspection using Scanning Acoustic Microscopy (SAM) can
identify small inclusions and other defects as small as 50-microns in high
purity metals and alloys (aluminum, zinc, cobalt, copper, titanium, zirconi=
um,
molybdenum, magnesium, and stainless steel).
=C2=A0
SAM, which is widely
accepted in the semiconductor industry as a failure analysis and reliabilit=
y
detection metrology, is now being applied to high purity metals and
alloys.
=C2=A0
The challenge is performing 100% inspection at sufficient
throughput speeds.
=C2=A0
Fortunately, recent advancements in SAM
technology have significantly improved throughput speeds and defect
detectability. A scan that previously might take 45 minutes to inspect an
8_10-inch square or disc alloy now only takes five minutes with more granul=
ar
detection of small impurities or defects.
=C2=A0
I would like to email you
a brand new two-page article that will tell you about a SAM that can delive=
r
immediately usable flaw detection results at an affordable
price.
=C2=A0
It will take about 5 minutes to read. May I email you the
report? Reply YES and we will email you the article.
