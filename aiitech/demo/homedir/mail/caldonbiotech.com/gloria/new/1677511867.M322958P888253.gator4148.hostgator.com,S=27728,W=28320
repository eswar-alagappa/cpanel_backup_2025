Characteristics and clinical significance of atypical mitosis in breast ca=

Atypical mitosis is considered a feature of malignancy=2C but its signific=

------------------------------------------------------------
Magic=2C joy=2C wisdom=2C and goats. Words seldom=E2=80=94if ever=E2=80=94=
used together in describing a pathology-focused website. Until now. Since=
 its launch in 2019=2C the platform=E2=80=94called Knowledge In Knowledge=
 Out=2C or KiKo (www.kikoxp.com)=E2=80=94has attracted more than 14=2C000=
 physicians=2C about 90 percent of whom are pathologists. The goal is to p=
rovide a place for doctors to share their clinical experiences and network=
 with each other in a professional online environment=2C says Jonhan Ho=2C=
 MD=2C who is founder and CEO of KiKo and director of the dermatopathology=
 division and fellowship director at the University of Pittsburgh Medical=
 Center.

KiKo is designed to give physicians more control over their professional p=
rofiles than they typically have in their institutional settings=2C Dr. Ho=
 explains. Many pathologists have a profile page on their hospital=E2=80=
=99s website=2C for example=2C but employers often control the format and=
 content of that profile. On KiKo=2C member pathologists can customize the=
ir profiles with videos=2C slides=2C personal information about their hobb=
ies and interests=2C and even whole slide images. For pathologists who don=
=E2=80=99t have access to whole slide imaging=2C Dr. Ho adds=2C KiKo offer=
s a whole slide image scanning service to which pathologists can submit th=
eir slides for a small fee that covers associated costs.

On his profile page=2C Dr. Ho has his curriculum vitae=2C links to journal=
 articles he has authored=2C and a digital version of a poster he presente=
d at a pathology conference. He also has a variety of medical and technolo=
gy-related posts and pictures of his family and goats. =E2=80=9CWe want yo=
u to feel like this is you in a way the CV can=E2=80=99t express=2C=E2=80=

 offers a whole slide image scanning service to which pathologists can sub=
mit their slides for a small fee that covers associated costs.<br><br>
