** Clinical pathology selected abstracts
A clinical trial evaluating tranexamic acid in children with traumatic inj=
ury (https://www.captodayonline.com/clinical-pathology-selected-abstracts-=
1222/)
------------------------------------------------------------

Tranexamic acid is an antifibrinolytic drug that improves survival in adul=
ts with traumatic hemorrhage. To the authors=E2=80=99 knowledge=2C it has=
 not been evaluated in a trial of injured children. Because trauma is the=
 leading cause of death and disability in children in the United States an=
d long-term outcomes are related to the degree of hemorrhage=2C stopping h=
emorrhaging quickly may reduce the number of interventions=2C complication=
s=2C and disabilities and improve recovery times in children. Tranexamic a=
cid (TXA) blocks plasmin-mediated fibrin clot breakdown and attenuates ble=
eding in the surgical setting. Although the efficacy and safety of the dru=
g have not been proven in children=2C TXA is routinely administered to sev=
erely injured children in the United Kingdom and Europe. The authors perfo=
rmed a pilot trial to assess the ability to identify children with severe=
 hemorrhagic injuries and enroll them in a trial evaluating two doses of T=
XA and a placebo.



** Link between HDL cholesterol and cardiovascular outcomes in high-risk p=
opulations (https://www.captodayonline.com/clinical-pathology-selected-abs=
tracts-1222/)
------------------------------------------------------------

High-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels have been inversely associated=
 with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Investigators have begu=
n to question the effectiveness of therapies designed to increase HDL chol=
esterol levels=2C such as cholesteryl ester transfer protein inhibition=2C=
 in reducing the disease. Some recent epidemiological studies involving po=
pulations that are free of cardiovascular disease have linked exceedingly=
 high levels of HDL cholesterol with higher mortality risk. The authors co=
nducted a study to investigate the association between HDL cholesterol lev=
els and outcomes in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD).

<p style=3D"text-align: left;">Tranexamic acid is an antifibrinolytic drug=
 that improves survival in adults with traumatic hemorrhage. To the author=
s=E2=80=99 knowledge=2C it has not been evaluated in a trial of injured ch=
ildren. Because trauma is the leading cause of death and disability in chi=
ldren in the United States and long-term outcomes are related to the degre=
e of hemorrhage=2C stopping hemorrhaging quickly may reduce the number of=
 interventions=2C complications=2C and disabilities and improve recovery t=
imes in children. Tranexamic acid (TXA) blocks plasmin-mediated fibrin clo=
t breakdown and attenuates bleeding in the surgical setting. Although the=
 efficacy and safety of the drug have not been proven in children=2C TXA i=
s routinely administered to severely injured children in the United Kingdo=
m and Europe. The authors performed a pilot trial to assess the ability to=
 identify children with severe hemorrhagic injuries and enroll them in a t=
rial evaluating two doses of TXA and a placebo.</p>
