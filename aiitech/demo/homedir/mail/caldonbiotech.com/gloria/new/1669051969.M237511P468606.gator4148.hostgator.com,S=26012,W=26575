Influenza incidence and what it will mean for testing in this respiratory=
 virus season is a wild card=2C as is how SARS-CoV-2 will evolve.

https://www.captodayonline.com

The who=2C what=2C and when of respiratory virus testing (https://www.capt=
odayonline.com/the-who-what-and-when-of-respiratory-virus-testing/) In mid=
-October=2C flu was picking up=2C with high levels of activity in Texas=2C=
 Georgia=2C the District of Columbia=2C South Carolina=2C Tennessee=2C and=
 New York. Elsewhere=2C it was still on the lower side=2C with less known=
 about what was to come but plans in place. And questions=2C too=2C about=
 laboratory testing as it relates to SARS-CoV-2=2C =E2=80=9Cwhich is going=
 to be a challenge=2C=E2=80=9D says David Peaper=2C MD=2C PhD=2C D(ABMM)=
=2C a member of the CAP Microbiology Committee. For example=2C how much te=
sting do those who have respiratory virus symptoms but who test negative a=
t home for SARS-CoV-2 need? Should schools require negative flu and respir=
atory syncytial virus test results in addition to a negative SARS-CoV-2 re=
sult in their COVID reentry protocols?

From the President=E2=80=99s Desk:The visible pathologist (https://www.cap=
todayonline.com/from-the-presidents-desk-1122/) Like me=2C many of you can=
 remember when you first thought about specializing in pathology=2C a deci=
sion that for a lot of us was made difficult by the notion of =E2=80=9Cdis=
appearing=E2=80=9D from the scene=E2=80=94working behind the scenes and in=
 relative obscurity. As a specialty we are not as self-explanatory as surg=
ery or pediatrics; indeed it can be exhausting for all concerned to explai=
n=2C even to our fellow physicians=2C what we do.

Machine-learning algorithms: how to detect and deter bias (https://www.cap=
todayonline.com/newsbytes-1122/)
------------------------------------------------------------
Bias=E2=80=94a type of prejudice that may go back to the beginning of huma=
nkind=E2=80=94has=2C in recent years=2C been the focus of attention with r=
egard to developing machine-learning algorithms for clinical laboratory te=
sting.

Clinical laboratory tests can hide data biases that could potentially gene=
rate misleading or even inaccurate results=2C says Brian Jackson=2C MD=2C=
 medical director of business development=2C information technology=2C and=
 support services=2C ARUP Laboratories=2C and associate professor of patho=
logy=2C University of Utah School of Medicine=2C Salt Lake City. =E2=80=9C=
When an algorithm gives you an answer to a question=2C but the algorithm d=
oesn=E2=80=99t display the logic by which it arrives at that answer=2C the=
 user is left at a big disadvantage in being able to see whether there=E2=
=80=99s bias going on.=E2=80=9D

To compensate for such potential issues=2C laboratories need to focus heav=
ily on quality control before implementing tests based on machine-learning=
 algorithms=2C Dr. Jackson says. =E2=80=9CI think the validation needs to=
 be even more aggressive than what we do for [other] laboratory tests=2C=
=E2=80=9D he adds.

Common types of biases that affect machine-learning algorithms include sam=
ple bias=2C exclusion bias=2C and measurement bias=2C says Christopher McC=
udden=2C PhD=2C clinical biochemist=2C Ottawa Hospital=2C and vice chair=
=2C Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine=2C University of Ottaw=
a=2C Ontario. Dr. McCudden is also deputy chief medical/scientific officer=
 for the Eastern Ontario Regional Laboratory Association.

Bias=E2=80=94a type of prejudice that may go back to the beginning of huma=
nkind=E2=80=94has=2C in recent years=2C been the focus of attention with r=
egard to developing machine-learning algorithms for clinical laboratory te=
sting.<br><br>

Clinical laboratory tests can hide data biases that could potentially gene=

 medical director of business development=2C information technology=2C and=
 support services=2C ARUP Laboratories=2C and associate professor of patho=
logy=2C University of Utah School of Medicine=2C Salt Lake City. =E2=80=9C=
When an algorithm gives you an answer to a question=2C but the algorithm d=
oesn=E2=80=99t display the logic by which it arrives at that answer=2C the=
 user is left at a big disadvantage in being able to see whether there=E2=
=80=99s bias going on.=E2=80=9D<br><br>

To compensate for such potential issues=2C laboratories need to focus heav=
ily on quality control before implementing tests based on machine-learning=
 algorithms=2C Dr. Jackson says. =E2=80=9CI think the validation needs to=
 be even more aggressive than what we do for [other] laboratory tests=2C=
=E2=80=9D he adds.<br><br>

Common types of biases that affect machine-learning algorithms include sam=
